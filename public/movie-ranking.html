 <h3>Coach Carter</h3>
 <p>
    This is one of the best endearing and motivational movie ever created. The stroy of perservance
    and hard work to overcome the challenges your placed into. A real underdog story of not to give
    and believe in yourself.

    Great story about friends and not giving up on one another.
 </p>
 <h3>Nightwatch</h3>
 <p>
    This can make the manlest man cry because this movie is about sacirifice and love. A story about
    real brotherhood and not taking any shit from anyone.
